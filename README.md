# Stellar Spectra Analysis
This project examines the effective temperature, surface gravity and abundance of different elements on the surface of red giant stars to look for correlations between the various features. We analyzed of abundance of iron on the surface of stars and the sun, explored the relationship between a red giant starâ€™s magnesium-to-iron abundance ratio and its effective temperature, and predicted surface gravity based on temperature and oxygen abundance.

Data is obtained from the [SDSS APOGEE survey](https://www.sdss4.org/dr17/irspec/) and was pre-processed by [Henry Leung](https://henrysky.github.io/).
