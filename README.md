# Stellar Spectra Analysis
Predicting surface gravity on red giant stars based on temperature and oxygen abundance.

Data is obtained from the [SDSS APOGEE survey](https://www.sdss4.org/dr17/irspec/). The dataset used contains 99,705 stellar spectra and associated measurements from red giant stars collected and pre-processed by [Henry Leung](https://henrysky.github.io/).
